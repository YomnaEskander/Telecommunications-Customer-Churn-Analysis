# Telecommunications Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

When customers discontinue using a company's services or products, it's known as customer churn. As a result, this costs a business a lot of money. By analyzing the reasons behind customer attrition, any business may prevent this issue and learn how to draw in new clients. I was able to examine a dataset named The Telecom Customer Churn using Power BI. To study the factors driving customer churn, the dataset includes demographic information, account details, and customer activity data.

## The questions that drived out the insights are:

* What percentage of customers have churned, stayed, or joined the service?
* Which contract type is associated with the highest churn?
* What is the total revenue lost due to customers who have churned?
* What internet service type contributes the most to customer retention?
