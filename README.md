# Telecommunications Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

When customers discontinue using a company's services or products, it's known as customer churn. As a result, this costs a business a lot of money. By analyzing the reasons behind customer attrition, any business may prevent this issue and learn how to draw in new clients. I was able to examine a dataset named The Telecom Customer Churn using Power BI. To study the factors driving customer churn, the dataset includes demographic information, account details, and customer activity data.

## The questions that drived out the insights are:

* What percentage of customers have churned, stayed, or joined the service?
* Which contract type is associated with the highest churn?
* What is the total revenue lost due to customers who have churned?
* What internet service type contributes the most to customer retention?

- High monthly charges correlate with a higher likelihood of churn.
- Total revenue lost due to churned customers is significant at **2.86M**, compared to revenue gained from new customers (**36K**).


##Recommendations 

-Encourage Longer-Term Contracts
Offer discounts, incentives, or loyalty perks to customers who switch from Month-to-Month contracts to Annual or Two-Year plans.
Provide better customer education on the benefits of long-term contracts (e.g., price stability, exclusive perks).
Implement a grace period or flexibility in contracts to reduce fear of long-term commitment.
Improve Fiber Optic Service Quality

-Improve Fiber Optic Service Quality
Since Fiber Optic customers have higher churn, investigate whether service reliability, pricing, or customer support is the issue.
Conduct surveys or collect feedback to understand why they are leaving.
Improve network performance and communicate enhancements to customers.
Address High Monthly Charges

-Address High Monthly Charges
Introduce tiered pricing models or customized plans that cater to different budget levels.
Offer discounts or bundled services (e.g., internet + TV + mobile) to lower perceived costs.
Provide a loyalty rewards program that gives long-term customers financial incentives.
