# Telecommunications Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

This project involves an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze customer churn trends and identify key factors contributing to churn for a telecommunications company. The analysis provides actionable insights to improve customer retention and optimize revenue.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Analyze customer churn behavior and highlight key drivers of churn and revenue impact using Power BI.
- **Dataset**: Telecommunications Customer Churn dataset, including features such as customer demographics, contract type, internet services, monthly charges, and churn status.

## Key Features
### Insights Generated:
1. **Churn Rate Analysis**:
   - Visualized overall churn rates using a **Pie Chart**.
   - Segmented customers into "Churned," "Joined," and "Stayed."

2. **Contract Type Insights**:
   - Used a **100% Stacked Bar Chart** to compare churn rates across contract types (Month-to-Month, One-Year, Two-Year).

3. **Internet Service Impact**:
   - Analyzed churn counts by internet type (Fiber Optic, DSL, Cable) using a **Clustered Bar Chart**.

4. **Revenue Insights**:
   - Highlighted total revenue lost due to churned customers (**2.86M**) and revenue gained from new customers (**36K**) using **KPI Cards**.

5. **Monthly Charges and Churn**:
   - Investigated whether higher monthly charges correlate with higher churn rates using a **Scatter Chart**.

## Tools and Techniques
### Tools:
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard design.

### Skills:
- **Data Cleaning**: Prepared the dataset for analysis by handling missing and inconsistent data.
- **Data Modeling**: Established relationships between tables for a cohesive analysis.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Created measures to calculate churn rates, total revenue, and monthly charge trends.

## Visualizations
- **Pie Chart**: Displays overall churn distribution.
- **100% Stacked Bar Chart**: Compares churn rates across contract types.
- **Clustered Bar Chart**: Shows churn counts for different internet types.
- **KPI Cards**: Highlights key metrics like total revenue lost and gained.
- **Scatter Chart**: Plots monthly charges against churn to identify trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following key features:
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, marital status, dependents.
- **Services**: Internet type, device protection, streaming services.
- **Financials**: Monthly charges, total charges, revenue.
- **Customer Status**: Churned, joined, or stayed.

### Source

## Key Insights
- Customers with Month-to-Month contracts exhibit the highest churn rates (45.84%).
- Fiber Optic customers are more likely to churn compared to DSL and Cable users.
- High monthly charges correlate with a higher likelihood of churn.
- Total revenue lost due to churned customers is significant at **2.86M**, compared to revenue gained from new customers (**36K**).
